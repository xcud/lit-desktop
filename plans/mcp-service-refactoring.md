# MCP Service Refactoring

## Overview

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) service has been refactored into a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. The previous monolithic implementation (~1300 lines) has been replaced with a more maintainable, testable design.

## Architecture

The new architecture consists of four main components:

### 1. ConfigurationManager

Responsible for loading, saving, and managing MCP configuration:
- Loads configuration from Electron Store or falls back to defaults
- Handles built-in services from built-in.json
- Manages cached tools for faster startup

### 2. ServerManager

Handles starting, stopping, and monitoring MCP servers:
- Manages the lifecycle of server processes
- Creates and maintains MCP client connections
- Infers protocol settings based on server type

### 3. ToolRegistry

Manages tool discovery, caching, and retrieval:
- Discovers tools from servers via MCP protocol
- Caches tools for future use
- Provides a unified view of all available tools

### 4. ToolExecutor

Handles the execution of tool calls:
- Routes tool calls to the appropriate server
- Provides fallback implementations for common tools
- Handles error cases and edge conditions

## Benefits

1. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a clear, focused responsibility.
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Common functionality is centralized in the appropriate component.
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across the codebase.
4. **Enhanced Testability**: Components can be tested independently.
5. **Better Maintainability**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to understand and modify.
6. **Extensibility**: Adding new functionality is simpler with a modular design.

## Next Steps

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Add Unit Tests**: Create comprehensive tests for each component.
2. **Improve Error Handling**: Add custom error types for better error identification.
3. **Enhance Logging**: Implement structured logging with different log levels.
4. **Add Dependency Injection**: For better testability and flexibility.
5. **Implement Caching Strategy**: Improve tool caching mechanism for better performance.
