# Ollama Service Refactoring

## Overview

The Ollama service has been refactored from a monolithic class (~1500 lines) into a modular architecture with focused components. This refactoring removes the problematic "doubled words" detection code and creates a more maintainable, testable structure.

## Architecture

The new architecture consists of four main components:

### 1. OllamaClient

Responsible for direct interactions with the Ollama API:
- Managing connections to the Ollama server
- Listing available models
- Processing chat requests and responses
- Handling model pulls

### 2. PromptMaster

Handles the creation and enhancement of prompts:
- Adds tool information to system prompts
- Manages system instructions for different scenarios
- Ensures consistent prompt formatting

### 3. ToolHandler

Specializes in tool-related functionality:
- Detects and extracts tool calls from LLM responses
- Normalizes tool parameters for consistency
- Executes tools via the MCP service
- Formats tool results for display

### 4. StreamManager

Manages streaming conversation interactions:
- Coordinates the streaming of responses from Ollama
- Buffers and delivers chunks to the client
- Handles tool calls in streaming conversations
- Manages the lifecycle of active streams

## Benefits

1. **Improved Code Organization**: Each component has a clear, focused responsibility.
2. **Better Error Handling**: More consistent error detection and recovery.
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to understand and modify.
4. **Removed Problematic Code**: Eliminated the doubled-word detection approach in favor of better JSON parsing.
5. **Better Testability**: Components can be tested independently.

## JSON Processing Improvements

The new implementation takes a more robust approach to JSON processing:
- Improved JSON extraction from text (handles markdown code blocks, etc.)
- Better braces balancing detection
- More targeted parameter normalization
- Cleaner error handling

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:
1. Add unit tests for each component
2. Implement more robust error types
3. Add logging levels for better diagnostics
4. Introduce configuration options for timeouts, buffer sizes, etc.
5. Further optimize the streaming performance
